# Litanies Against the Seven Deadly Sins  
**By Kris Yotam**  

---

#### LUST  
I must not lust. Lust is the allure of fleeting desires. Lust is the poison that corrupts the soul. I will face my lust. I will acknowledge its pull, yet not succumb. And when its allure fades, I will look inward to understand its root. Where lust once held sway, there will be purity. Only virtue will remain.

#### GLUTTONY  
I must not indulge in gluttony. Gluttony is the insatiable hunger that consumes reason. Gluttony is the weight that burdens the spirit. I will face my gluttony. I will recognize its craving, yet temper its excesses. And when its grip loosens, I will reflect on its lesson. Where gluttony once reigned, there will be balance. Only moderation will remain.

#### GREED  
I must not covet. Greed is the thirst for wealth that blinds the heart. Greed is the hunger that devours generosity. I will face my greed. I will confront its avarice, yet cultivate contentment. And when its grasp weakens, I will seek clarity. Where greed once held sway, there will be abundance. Only gratitude will remain.

#### SLOTH  
I must not yield to sloth. Sloth is the inertia that stifles growth. Sloth is the slumber that dulls ambition. I will face my sloth. I will rouse from idleness, embracing diligence. And when its lethargy wanes, I will strive for progress. Where sloth once lingered, there will be vitality. Only diligence will remain.

#### WRATH  
I must not succumb to wrath. Wrath is the flame that consumes reason. Wrath is the storm that clouds judgment. I will face my wrath. I will harness its energy, yet temper its fury. And when its rage subsides, I will seek peace. Where wrath once raged, there will be tranquility. Only harmony will remain.

#### ENVY  
I must not harbor envy. Envy is the shadow that eclipses joy. Envy is the poison that corrodes contentment. I will face my envy. I will celebrate the success of others, rejoicing in their fortune. And when its bitterness fades, I will embrace admiration. Where envy once lingered, there will be camaraderie. Only kindness will remain.

#### FEAR  
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
