# Life

The Child who just received a nintendo  
switch for her 8th birthday  

The man who had to hitch a ride home only  
to find his mother's death  

The piquant taste of sugar straight from the  
cane  

The same sugar that leaves 88 thousand slain  

A mundane day of tedious tasks  
Not knowing that somewhere else is a  
person's last  

The freedom of a deer with the world to  
explore  

Its life stripped away by a lion's vigor  

We all think we see the big picture  
How long until we realize  
the real one's upside down
