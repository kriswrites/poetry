## Upon the Wings of Doves

Beneath the azure sky where breezes play,
A gentle dove ascends with wings of peace.
Its feathers gleam like light at break of day,
A sacred sign of hope that will not cease.

In flight it weaves a story soft and pure,
Of love unbroken, bound by Heaven’s grace.
Its call, though meek, has power to endure,
And fills the heart with calm in storm’s embrace.

O dove, celestial herald from above,
What truths you carry softly in your flight?
Of mercy’s song, or YHWH’s endless love,
To guide the weary through their darkest night?

So may we, too, in faith and love arise,
Like doves ascending through eternal skies.
