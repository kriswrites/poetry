# Antiphon for the Seraphim  
**By Kris Yotam**  

---

You are the complete ones,  

Whose burning desire permeates in the presence of the Perfect One.  

You, the **al-mash’ama** (companions of the flame),  

The ones who extol the Lord unfalteringly,  

The ones whose faith is pure and without fail.  

Admiration for the **Seraph**.  

Reverence to the **Burning Ones**.
