## Haiku Series 1 “Echoes of Past”
**By Kris Yotam**

Uncategorized  
A series of my first haikus in high school.

### Tachyon
Faster than light  
Moving forever, nothing in sight  
Blink darkness  

### Yersinia Pestis
Out of these boils  
Pours darkness I behold  
I awaken in a coffin  

### Fission
Forever separated  
Our power was evaporated  
Split but equal  

### Knowledge
Fools think they have it  
The shrewd know they must have it  
Just go get a book
